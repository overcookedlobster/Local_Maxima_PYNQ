PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A2' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=(A4*A5)+(A4*(~A5)*(~A1))+((~A4))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/local_maxima_zybo_0/inst/dut/read_enable is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/local_maxima_zybo_0/inst/dut/read_enable_INST_0/O, cell design_1_i/local_maxima_zybo_0/inst/dut/read_enable_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-181#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (design_1_i/blk_mem_gen_1/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.WIDE_PRIM36_NO_ECC.ram) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design.
